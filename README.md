# Drop64

Nintendo N64 displayed in a browser window and controlled by a smartphone. Emscripten compiled mupen64plus, ionic app, and socket.io proxy of input. 

To run: 

```
npm install
npm start 
```

Go to [localhost:3000/](localhost:3000) in your browser and [localhost:3000/controller](localhost:3000/controller) on phone. 

Games are not hosted here, go find a ROM for the game you want to play. You'll need to upload it on the display page.

Note that the controller portion of this app comes in a smartphone flavor too. See damouse/Drop64_App for that version.

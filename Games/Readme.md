I don't know where theses games are from, or how they were obtained, all i know is i have around 280 N64 games on this device, and i can only upload some bcuase of the size. 
So if you want more that whats on here, i can try to get a copy and upload it. To downlaod it, click download the zip file or the z64 file. Then on the emulator, insert it there.
